# QVI-Data-Analytics
# Analysis of Customer Purchasing Behavior &amp; Uplift Testing

### Background
# I was helping a supermarket to analyze customer purchasing behavior of a specific category to identify 
# identify trends and inconsistencies.

# To perform analysis, I developed metrics and examine sales drivers to gain insights into overall sales performance.

# When I gained insights on customer purchasing behavior of the category, I wanted to experiemented if changing the layout of products would affect sales. Therefore I designed A/B testing and defined matrics to select control stores, and I analyzed trial stores against controls.

# After analysis, I created a business report based on the Pyramic Principles framework and presented the report that incorporated data visualizations, key insights, and recommendations
